        <li>A better understanding of computing systems as a whole</li>

    <h2>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>
    <p> Currently my favorite hobby is golf. I really enjoy playing the many courses around the 
        Chicago area with my friends. Golf is a very hard sport, but it is also extremely rewarding.
         <br>Some of my other hobbies include going to the gym, working on cars, playing soccer,
          and I also enjoy learning about and working with new tech. </p>
    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>

        part-time while in school.</p>
